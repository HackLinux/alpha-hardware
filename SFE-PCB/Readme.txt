-) double check the footprints (FMC connector seems correct, but the sensor socket should be checked)
-) turn off "snap to grid" feature and manually adjust the spacing on the LVDS pairs as per the schematic note. 
I usually do this by placing a silkscreen trace of the correct width and aligning the traces at the edge of the silkscreen.
-) check dimensions of the PCB and if we will get into the way of anything on the zedboard
