-) power supply stuff and the power plane splits.
-) double check the footprints (FMC connector seems correct, but the sensor socket should be checked)
-) turn off "snap to grid" feature and manually adjust the spacing on the LVDS pairs as per the schematic note. I usually do this by placing a silkscreen trace of the correct width and aligning the traces at the edge of the silkscreen.
-) Account for holes to mount PCB to lens mount (specs will follow soon)
