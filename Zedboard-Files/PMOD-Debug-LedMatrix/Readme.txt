About
---------
A very small PCB sporting 64 LEDs that connect to most FPGA development boards (like the Zedboard) with a PMOD interface
This PCB provides an easy way to debug FPGA logic with just 8 digital lines and a 4-to-16 line decoder with minimal interface logic required in the FPGA side (PL).
